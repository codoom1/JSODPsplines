Description: Tools for estimating derivatives of functions using P-splines. 
    The main feature is the 'resub' method, a novel approach developed to 
    improve derivative estimation. The package also includes methods for 
    penalized spline estimation, oracle estimation, and optimization of 
    smoothing parameters using generalized cross-validation (GCV) and 
    Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE).
