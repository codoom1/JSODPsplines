Description: This package provides tools for estimating derivatives of functions using P-splines. Its main feature is the `resub` method, a novel approach developed to improve derivative estimation. The package also includes methods for penalized spline estimation, oracle estimation, and optimization of smoothing parameters using generalized cross-validation (GCV) and Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE).
